# MariaDB Installation and Setup on Ubuntu

### ⚙ Step 1: Update your system

bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
 


Keeps your system packages up to date and secure.

---

### 🧩 Step 2: Install MariaDB server and client

bash
sudo apt install -y mariadb-server mariadb-client



---

### 🚀 Step 3: Start and enable MariaDB

bash
sudo systemctl enable --now mariadb
sudo systemctl status mariadb --no-pager



✅ If you see active (running), MariaDB is successfully running.

---

### 🔐 Step 4: Secure MariaDB installation

Run the built-in security script:

bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation



When prompted, respond *Y* to all recommended options:

- Set root password → Y
- Remove anonymous users → Y
- Disallow remote root login → Y
- Remove test database → Y
- Reload privilege tables → Y

---

### 💻 Step 5: Log in to MariaDB

- If you set a root password:

bash
mysql -u root -p



- If using unix_socket authentication:

bash
sudo mariadb



---

### 🧱 Step 6: Create a database and user

Inside the MariaDB shell:

CREATE USER 'naiim'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '12345';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'naiim'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;




---

### 🧠 Step 7: Test your new user

bash
mysql -u naiim -p 



✅ If you can log in and see MariaDB [mydb]>, it’s working perfectly!

---

### 🌐 Step 8: Allow remote connections

Check MariaDB is listening on your server:

bash
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep mariadb



Edit the MariaDB config file:

bash
sudo vim /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf



Find the line:


bind-address = 127.0.0.1



Replace it with your server IP (e.g., 192.168.10.132):


bind-address = 192.168.10.132



Save and exit (Ctrl+O → Enter → Ctrl+X).

Restart MariaDB:

bash
sudo systemctl restart mariadb



sudo ufw allow 3306/tcp
sudo ufw reload









---

### 🔑 Step 9: Grant remote access to root (optional)

sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'192.168.10.42' IDENTIFIED BY '12345Q' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;



---

🎉 MariaDB is now installed, secured, and ready for both local and remote access.

If you want, I can also make a *colorful emoji-style version* of these steps that’s easier to follow at a glance. Do you want me to do that?

### You said:

CREATE DATABASE mydb;
CREATE USER 'myuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mydb.* TO 'myuser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;

for all host and full privileges, 
username lubna
pass its@1998

### ChatGPT said:

Sure! If you want to create a MariaDB user lubna with password its@1998 that has *full privileges on all databases* and can connect from *any host*, here’s the SQL you should run inside the MariaDB shell:

sql
-- Create the user for all hosts
CREATE USER 'lubna'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'its@1998';

-- Grant full privileges on all databases
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'lubna'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;

-- Apply the changes
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

-- Exit the MariaDB shell
EXIT;



✅ Explanation:

- 'lubna'@'%' → % means the user can connect from *any host*.
- GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* → gives access to *all databases and tables*.
- WITH GRANT OPTION → allows this user to grant privileges to other users.

---

If you want, I can also give the *same setup plus a local-only user* for extra security, so you can safely use remote access while keeping root-level access restricted. Do you want me to do that?
